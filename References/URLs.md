[Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/)

Some tips from the Microsoft article above:
1. Use gender neutral phrasing by using 'you' when applicable. For example,
   Do not say : If the user has created a resource group, he can add resources to this group.
   Instead try , You can add resources to an already created resource group.

2. Capitalise only the first letter of the sentence and proper nouns.
3. Prepare the document template before you start. Have limited formats for headings and sub headings.
4. Write with the audience in mind.
5. Be cognizant of the timeline of document delivery.
6. Decsribe the problem you are solving before code sample , so that the user gets a better understanding of the code.
7. Use contractionsfor project friendliness . For example, use "you'll"  instead of "you will" ,"you're" instead of "you are".
8. Use fewer words.
